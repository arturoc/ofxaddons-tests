This PR includes test files for travis and appveyor ci services, once you merge it any new commit or PR to your repository will compile this addon for every supported platform against the latest openFrameworks.

This new files can be customized but we recommend to not touch them much except for commenting or uncommenting the different platfoms to test. That way we can ensure that the addon will work for any standard setup. The testing can be further customized (for example to install some dependencies in certain platforms by using some scripts in scripts/platforms there's more instructions on how to use them in the .travis.yml and appveyor.yml files in this PR.

Once your addon tests are working you can add a badge to your readme files so people using your addon can see the build status:

For travis you can just copy and paste the following markdown:

```
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/{owner}/{repo}.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/{owner}/{repo})
```

which will look like: [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/{owner}/{repo}.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/{owner}/{repo})

For appveyor you can find the badge code at https://ci.appveyor.com/project/{owner}/{repo}/settings/badges
